## Application Model

![Application Model](./images/application.png)

The application model is illustrated as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), highlighting the tasks and their dependencies. Nodes within the DAG represent individual tasks, each annotated with attributes such as deadlines and worst case execution times. Directed edges between nodes depict the dependency relationships among tasks, signifying that a task can only commence once all its prerequisite tasks (predecessors) have been completed.

## Platform Model

![Platform Model](./images/platform.png)
The platform model features multiple nodes, each with different roles including compute nodes, routers, sensors, and actuators. Tasks are distributed across these nodes, and the scheduling decisions are made based on task deadlines and dependencies, ensuring that tasks are executed in accordance with their timing constraints. The model supports parallel task execution on multiple compute nodes, with data transmission facilitated by routers and interactions with the physical environment managed by sensors and actuators. This setup allows for complex, distributed scheduling scenarios, reflecting a realistic multi-node platform environment

## JSON Input

The input to the scheduling algorithms is a JSON object that describes the application and platform models. The application model includes tasks and messages, while the platform model includes nodes and links. The JSON input contains following objects and should conform to the [input JSON schema](./input_schema.json).

- **Tasks**: Represent the tasks to be scheduled.
- **Messages**: Represent dependencies between tasks.
- **Nodes**: Represent the either a compute node where tasks can be executed or router in the network or a sensor or a actuators.
- **Links**: Represent the communication links between nodes.

## Earliest Deadline First (EDF) for Single Node

The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm is used to schedule tasks on a single computational node by prioritizing tasks based on their deadlines. The primary objective is to ensure tasks with the nearest deadlines are executed first, optimizing the schedule to meet critical time constraints and minimizing the risk of missed deadlines.

### Scheduling Mechanism

#### Initialization

- The process begins with the identification and representation of all tasks and their dependencies within the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Initial tasks, which have no dependencies (root nodes), are identified and marked as ready for scheduling.

#### Selection of Tasks

- Among the tasks that are ready for execution, the task with the earliest deadline is selected. This task is prioritized to ensure that the most time-sensitive operations are addressed first.

#### Task Execution

- The selected task is then scheduled on the computational node. The start time is determined based on the node's availability, and the task is executed for a duration corresponding to its WCET. The end time is calculated and recorded.

#### Dependency Resolution

- Upon the completion of a task, the scheduler evaluates its dependent tasks. If all dependencies of a subsequent task are resolved (i.e., all predecessor tasks are completed), this task becomes eligible for scheduling.

#### Iterative Scheduling

- The scheduling process iterates through the available tasks, continuously selecting and scheduling tasks based on their deadlines. The system dynamically updates the status of tasks and their dependencies, ensuring that at each step, the task with the nearest deadline is chosen.

#### Handling Deadline Misses

- If a task's execution is anticipated to exceed its deadline, it is marked as a missed deadline. The scheduler records such instances and evaluates the impact on subsequent tasks. Efforts are made to minimize the cascading effects of missed deadlines on the overall schedule.

#### Final Schedule Compilation

- At the conclusion of the scheduling process, a comprehensive schedule is compiled. This includes detailed records of task start and end times, deadlines, and any instances of missed deadlines. The final schedule provides a clear overview of task execution and node utilization.

#### Example

Let's understand EDF scheduling for a single node using the Example above:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 20,
      "deadline": 40,
      "start_time": 0,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 80,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 2,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 5,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 80,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 60,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 6,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 100,
      "deadline": 120,
      "start_time": 80,
      "execution_time": 20
    }
  ],
  "missed_deadlines": [4],
  "name": "EDF Single-node"
}
```

Consider the application model described above. Analyzing the order of tasks:

- **Task 1** is executed first because it has no predecessors blocking its execution. It starts at time 0 and finishes at time 20, well ahead of its deadline of 40.
- **Task 3** is next in line, starting right after Task 1 at time 20 and finishing at time 40. It also meets its deadline of 80.
- **Task 2** is scheduled once Task 3 completes, beginning at time 40 and ending at time 60, well before its deadline of 100.
- **Task 5** starts right after Task 2 finishes, beginning at time 60 and completing at time 80, meeting its deadline of 100.
- **Task 6** is the last task to be scheduled. It starts at time 80 and finishes at time 100, just before its deadline of 120.

However, **Task 4** misses its deadline, as indicated in the missed deadlines list.

## Latest Deadline First (LDF) for Single Node

The Latest Deadline First (LDF) scheduling algorithm for a single node prioritizes tasks based on their latest deadlines, ensuring that tasks with the furthest deadlines are scheduled first. This strategy allows for more flexibility in handling tasks with earlier deadlines.

### Scheduling Mechanism

#### Initialization

- The algorithm begins by identifying all tasks with no successors (leaf nodes) in the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). These tasks are initially added to the set of tasks that can be scheduled.

#### Selection of Tasks

- Among the tasks that can be scheduled, the task with the latest deadline is selected for execution. This key step defines the "right-to-left" scheduling behavior.

#### Task Execution

- Once a task is selected, it is scheduled for execution on the single computational node. The start and end time is determined based on the start time of the previously scheduled task, ensuring no overlap. Due to the "right-to-left" behavior new tasks are scheduled right before the previously scheduled task.

#### Dependency Management

- After scheduling a task, the algorithm updates the set of tasks that can be scheduled next. This involves checking the predecessors of the currently scheduled task. If all successors of a predecessor task have been scheduled, the predecessor task becomes eligible for scheduling.

#### Iterative Scheduling

- The scheduling process iterates through the available tasks, continuously selecting and scheduling tasks based on their latest deadlines. The system dynamically updates the status of tasks and their dependencies, ensuring that at each step, the task with the latest deadline is chosen.

#### Handling Task Completion and Deadlines

- The end time of each task is calculated based on its Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET). If a task's completion time exceeds its deadline, it is marked as a missed deadline and tasks dependent on it that have already scheduled have to be removed from the schedule. The algorithm continues this process until all tasks are scheduled.

This method maximizes the utilization of available time before their deadlines, while allowing tasks with earlier deadlines to be handled with the flexibility provided by scheduling tasks with later deadlines first. The LDF algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where tasks with later deadlines are more critical or have higher priority for completion.

#### Example

Consider the application model described by the DAG. Analyzing the order of tasks:

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 20,
      "deadline": 40,
      "start_time": 0,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 2,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 4,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 77,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 80,
      "deadline": 80,
      "start_time": 60,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 5,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 100,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 80,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 6,
      "node_id": 0,
      "end_time": 120,
      "deadline": 120,
      "start_time": 100,
      "execution_time": 20
    }
  ],
  "missed_deadlines": [],
  "name": "LDF Single-node"
}
```

- **Task 1** is executed first because it has the earliest deadline. It starts at time 0 and finishes at time 20, meeting its deadline of 40.
- **Task 2** starts immediately after Task 1, beginning at time 20 and completing at time 40, well ahead of its deadline of 100.
- **Task 4** is scheduled next, starting at time 40 and finishing at time 60. It meets its deadline of 77.
- **Task 3** follows Task 4, starting at time 60 and ending at time 80, just before its deadline of 80.
- **Task 5** is then scheduled, starting at time 80 and finishing at time 100, meeting its deadline of 100.
- **Task 6** is the final task. It starts at time 100 and finishes at time 120, meeting its deadline of 120.

No deadlines were missed in this schedule.

## Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Multi-Node (Without Communication Delay)

The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Multi-Node (Without Communication Delay) algorithm is an extension of the EDF strategy applied to a multi-node environment. In this variant, tasks are scheduled across multiple computational nodes, prioritizing those with the earliest deadlines, while assuming that there is no communication delay between nodes. This simplifies the scheduling process, where task execution time and node availability are the primary factors considered.

### Scheduling Mechanism

#### Initialization

- **Identify Root Tasks:** The algorithm begins by identifying tasks with no dependencies (root tasks) and schedules them for execution on available nodes immediately.

#### Node Selection

- Tasks are assigned to computational nodes based on their availability, prioritizing the earliest available node for execution.

#### Task Distribution and Execution

- Once root tasks are completed, their dependent tasks are checked. Among these, the task with the earliest deadline is selected for execution.
- Tasks are scheduled on nodes based on the earliest available time, allowing independent tasks to execute concurrently across nodes.

#### Managing Dependencies

- The algorithm continuously monitors dependencies between tasks, only allowing a task to be scheduled once all its predecessors have finished executing.
- Task dependencies are respected, and the availability of a task for scheduling is updated dynamically as the schedule progresses.

#### Handling Concurrent Execution

- Multiple tasks that are independent of each other can be scheduled for execution concurrently on different nodes, taking advantage of parallel processing capabilities.
- This concurrent execution improves scheduling efficiency and increases the likelihood of meeting task deadlines.

#### Scheduling and Deadline Management

- The start time of each task is determined by the completion time of its preceding tasks, along with the availability of the node.
- Task end times are calculated using the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) of the task. If a task's end time exceeds its deadline, it is flagged as a missed deadline.
- By consistently prioritizing tasks with the earliest deadlines, the algorithm seeks to minimize missed deadlines.

### Example

Consider an example of scheduling tasks on a multi-node platform using EDF without communication delay.

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "node_id": 1,
      "end_time": 20,
      "deadline": 40,
      "start_time": 0,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,
      "node_id": 2,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 80,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 2,
      "node_id": 3,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 4,
      "node_id": 4,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 77,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 5,
      "node_id": 5,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 6,
      "node_id": 6,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 120,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    }
  ],
  "missed_deadlines": [],
  "name": "EDF Multinode(without delay)"
}
```

- **Task 1** is scheduled on Node 1. It starts at time 0 and finishes at time 20, meeting its deadline of 40.
- **Task 3** executes on Node 2, beginning at time 20 and completing at time 40, well before its deadline of 80.
- **Task 2** runs on Node 3, starting at time 20 and finishing at time 40, which is well within its deadline of 100.
- **Task 4** is assigned to Node 4, starting at time 40 and ending at time 60, meeting its deadline of 77.
- **Task 5** is scheduled on Node 5, starting at time 40 and finishing at time 60, which meets its deadline of 100.
- **Task 6** runs on Node 6, starting at time 40 and ending at time 60, well within its deadline of 120.

- No deadlines were missed in this schedule.

## Latest Deadline First (LDF) Multinode (Without Communication Delay)

The **Latest Deadline First (LDF) Multi-Node (Without Communication Delay)** algorithm schedules tasks based on the latest possible deadlines in a multi-node environment. Unlike EDF, which prioritizes the earliest deadlines, LDF selects tasks that can afford to be scheduled later while still meeting their deadlines. In this variant, no communication delay between nodes is considered, simplifying the scheduling process.

### Scheduling Mechanism

#### Initialization

- **Identify Leaf Tasks:** The algorithm begins by identifying tasks with no successors (leaf tasks). These tasks are selected first for scheduling.
- **Task ordering:** Tasks are first ordered in the order they would be scheduled on a single node setup, enabling the final schedule to be build from left-to-right since the order is already known.
- **Task Selection:** The tasks with the latest deadlines are prioritized for scheduling first, enabling other tasks with earlier deadlines to wait as long as possible.

#### Node Selection

- Tasks are assigned to computational nodes based on their availability, ensuring that the latest-deadline tasks are scheduled on the first available node.

#### Task Distribution and Execution

- Once leaf tasks are scheduled, the algorithm checks their predecessors. Among the predecessors whose successors have all been completed, the one with the latest deadline is selected for scheduling.
- Tasks are distributed across nodes based on the earliest available time, taking advantage of concurrent execution when possible.

#### Managing Dependencies

- The algorithm continuously monitors task dependencies, ensuring that a task can only be scheduled when all its successors have been executed.
- Predecessor tasks are dynamically added to the schedulable pool as their successors finish execution.

#### Handling Concurrent Execution

- Tasks that are independent of each other can execute concurrently across different nodes, utilizing multi-node parallelism to increase efficiency.
- Parallel execution ensures that more tasks are able to meet their deadlines by taking advantage of idle nodes.

#### Scheduling and Deadline Management

- The start time of each task depends on the completion time of its predecessors, combined with the availability of the assigned node.
- The task's end time is determined by its Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET). If the task exceeds its deadline, it is flagged as a missed deadline, and subsequent dependent tasks are removed from the schedule to prevent further violations.
- By selecting tasks with the latest deadlines, the algorithm delays task execution as much as possible while aiming to avoid missing deadlines.

### Example

Let's explore an example of scheduling tasks on a multi-node platform using LDF without communication delay.

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "node_id": 1,

    },
    {

- **Task 1** is scheduled on Node 1. It starts at time 0 and finishes at time 20, meeting its deadline of 40.
- **Task 2** runs on Node 2, starting at time 20 and completing at time 40, which is well within its deadline of 100.
- **Task 4** is executed on Node 3, beginning at time 40 and finishing at time 60, meeting its deadline of 77.
- **Task 3** is assigned to Node 4, starting at time 20 and finishing at time 40, which meets its deadline of 80.
- **Task 5** is scheduled on Node 5, starting at time 40 and completing at time 60, meeting its deadline of 100.
- **Task 6** runs on Node 6, starting at time 40 and finishing at time 60, which is well within its deadline of 120.

- No deadlines were missed in this schedule.

## Least Laxity First (LLF) Multinode (Without Communication Delay)

The Least Laxity First (LLF) scheduling algorithm for multi-node environments prioritizes tasks based on their laxity, which is the difference between the task’s deadline and the time remaining to complete its execution. LLF aims to minimize the likelihood of missed deadlines by executing tasks with the least laxity first. This version assumes no communication delays between the nodes.

### Scheduling Mechanism

#### Initial Task Scheduling

1. **Identify Root Tasks:**

   - The algorithm starts by identifying tasks with no unsatisfied dependencies (root nodes) that can be scheduled immediately.
   - Root tasks are added to the schedulable set since they do not depend on other tasks in the directed acyclic graph (DAG).

2. **Calculate Laxity:**

   - Compute the laxity of each root task based on the current time, deadline, and worst-case execution time (WCET).
   - The laxity $ L_i $ for task $i$ is calculated as:

     $$
     L_i = \text{deadline}_i - (\text{current time} + \text{WCET}_i)
     $$

#### Task Distribution and Execution

3. **Select Task with Least Laxity:**

   - Among the set of schedulable tasks, select the task with the smallest laxity value, denoted as $\text{task}_\text{min}$.

4. **Assign Task to Node:**

   - Allocate $\text{task}_\text{min}$ to the node that becomes available first. This ensures tasks are scheduled on nodes as soon as possible to meet deadlines.

5. **Update Node Availability:**

   - Once $\text{task}_\text{min}$ is scheduled, update the availability of the assigned node by adding the execution time of the task to the current time.
   - The new availability time for the node is calculated as:

     $$

     \text{Node}_\text{avail} = \text{current time} + \text{WCET}_\text{min}


     $$

#### Managing Dependencies

6. **Handle Task Dependencies:**
   - Once a task is completed, the algorithm checks the readiness of its dependent tasks.
   - A dependent task can only be scheduled once all its predecessor tasks have finished executing.

#### Deadline Management

7. **Monitor Deadlines:**
   - Continuously monitor task execution to ensure deadlines are met.
   - If a task’s completion time exceeds its deadline, it is marked as a missed deadline, and future scheduling decisions are adjusted accordingly.

#### Example

Let’s look at an example of LLF scheduling in a multi-node environment.

```json
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "node_id": 1,
      "end_time": 20,
      "deadline": 40,
      "start_time": 0,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 3,
      "node_id": 2,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 80,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 2,
      "node_id": 3,
      "end_time": 40,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 20,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 4,
      "node_id": 4,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 77,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 5,
      "node_id": 5,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 100,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    },
    {
      "task_id": 6,
      "node_id": 6,
      "end_time": 60,
      "deadline": 120,
      "start_time": 40,
      "execution_time": 20
    }
  ],
  "missed_deadlines": [],
  "name": "LL(without delay)"
}
```

- **Task 1** is scheduled on Node 1, starting at time 0 and finishing at time 20, meeting its deadline of 40.
- **Task 3** runs on Node 2, beginning at time 20 and completing at time 40, which meets its deadline of 80.
- **Task 2** is assigned to Node 3, starting at time 20 and finishing at time 40, well within its deadline of 100.
- **Task 4** is executed on Node 4, starting at time 40 and finishing at time 60, meeting its deadline of 77.
- **Task 5** runs on Node 5, beginning at time 40 and completing at time 60, meeting its deadline of 100.
- **Task 6** is scheduled on Node 6, starting at time 40 and finishing at time 60, which is well within its deadline of 120.

- No deadlines were missed in this schedule.
